One of my favorite Youtube channels is called Epic Rap Battles of History (ERB for short); in each video, two or more historical figures (sometimes contemporaries of each other, many times not) face off in a rap battle where they trade clever insults for 2-8 minutes. It's quite entertaining and I've always admired how adept the channel creators are at weaponining facts about each historical figure through the lyrics they write.

Why am I bringing this channel up? Well, last week, my husband and I watched the Jeopardy Turnament of Champions. I was beyond blown away by the amount of trivia that each contestant knew. I wondered what it must take for someone to be able to commit that much information to memory and selectively access it at a moment's notice. I figured that that kind of mental prowess was probably only reserved for the type of people who participated in trivia bowls and studied history for fun as children. [*Kudos to those folks by the way. People dream of being able to make money off of their hobbies. If you ever make it onto Jeopardy, those years of knowledge-building could really pay off!*]

Anywho, fast forward to yesterday when a random thought occurred to me: the ERB creators would probably __kill__ at Jeopardy. The characters they enact in these videos were prominent in many different fields, including music, science, philosophy, government, etc. The nature of the creators' craft requires them to research not the personal life of each character that they intend to put in a battle, the impact they left on the world, the time period in which they lived, etc. As much trivia about each character as they cram into the video, they probably leave twice as much as that on the "cutting room floor" when they edit out facts that either don't fit well into a bar or don't work well as an insult. 

I say all that to say that, while these guys might struggle in Jeopardy categories like 'Before & After' or 'Word Origins', they would probably clean house in many others. And since I know the lyrics to many of the ERB songs by heart, maybe that means I would have a small chance of winning big in Jeopardy too :-)
